# React Pug Fun 🐶💕
### A little React app about my favorite puppers. 

#### To install just clone the repo and run:
```
npm install
```

#### To run first compile your less with
```
lessc src/css/**.less build/styles.css
```
then:
```
npm start
```

This will start webpack dev server on port: ```8080```. It will watch for front end changes so you can just refresh as you write some react!

Stuff I'm going to be adding:
* TESTS WITH MOCHA/CHAI or maybe Jasmine but I want to get better with mocha so...
* LESS/style watcher
* gulp
* Redux if I end up needing a way to share state between components
